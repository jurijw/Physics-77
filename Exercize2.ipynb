    "\n",
    "Your program should include two user-defined functions that you may find helpful in accomplishing your goal:\n",

    "1. A function `energy(n1, n2, n3)` that takes integer values $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$, and computes the corresponding energy level in units of $\\hbar^2 \\pi^2/2 m L_1^2$.\n",

A function `lowest_unique_K(K, List)` which takes a positive integer $K$ and a list of real numbers `List`, and returns an ordered (ascending) list of the lowest $K$ unique numbers in the list `List`. For instance, `lowest_unique_K(3, [-0.5, 3, 3, 2, 6, 7, 7])` would return `[-0.5, 2, 3]`. The function should not modify the original list `List`.\n",

Depending on how you do it, you may or may not find it helpful to recall \"Program 9\" in the Workshop's \"Debugging Practice\" (about copying lists), or to Google how to \"sort\" lists, or how to \"del\" or \"pop\" items out of lists.\n",

    "You may also wish to make other user-defined functions depending on how you go about solving the problem. In fact, if you find some clever way to solve the problem that doesn't use `lowest_unique_K`, that is fine too! (You still need to write `lowest_unique_K`, though.) But whatever you do, be sure to comment your code clearly!\n",
